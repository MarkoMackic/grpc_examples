# Short notes

DockerDesktop is required to use the provided proxy setup.

Server should be started before playing with this.

For configurable stuff look at config.js.

Enter the client app and execute:
```
yarn
yarn webpack 
yarn webpack server
```

In another cmd run 

```
node proxy_deploy.js
```
